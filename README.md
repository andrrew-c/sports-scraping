In game betting and scarping related to sports

## Purpose

This project started in 2017.  I started this originally because I was interested in the live, in game, betting provided by online sites, such as William Hill.  I tried to find a way to download the data (badly) using Excel and VBA and got nowhere.  Later on, with some more experian with Python I have been able to get the project to run, using football data only

It collects live data, during play on various tournaments. Teams are recorded and scores and changing odds are scraped.  The code uses an instance of a chrome browser, using Selenium to drive Chrome.  I run this on a headless Unix box.
